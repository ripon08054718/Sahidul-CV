	{\small PCA is a very promising old technique for dimension reduction. Also it is used for latent structure detection, clustering and outliers detection in multivariate dataset. In this thesis ICA is used for latent structure detection, clustering and outliers detection and compared it with that of PCA. More than 16 real and simulated datasets are used in this dissertation.}
